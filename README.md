# Optimization guide for Minecraft servers
This guide will help you optimize your Minecraft server to reduce lag and improve the performance.

# Java Edition
## Vanilla

## Forge

## FabricMC
One of the best ways to reduce lag is using performance mods. You can find a list of performance mods that are server-side only to improve your performance [here](https://github.com/comp500/fabric-serverside-mods/blob/main/README.md#performance).
Some reasons that might increase lags are described in the following list with a possible solution:
* Too many mods: Usually mods don't give enough lag except heavy mods. Make sure you only use the important mods.
* Too many entities: This might cause lag to your world, to fix this you can execute the command `/kill @e[type=NAME]` where NAME would be the name of the entitie, e.g. `/kill @e[type=item]` will delete all dropped items. For more information about the command, read [this guide](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/kill).
* RAM too low: Increasing your server RAM will not always fix lag but might improve a little your server performance.
* randomTickSpeed value too high: Increasing the gamerule randomTickSpeed value to a really high value can have a bad performance on your server. It is recommended to always set it to the default value, which is `3`.

## Spigot

## PaperMC

## MohistMC

## Modpacks
It's hard to have a good performance using modpacks, mostly because modpacks usually have too many heavy mods. Some solutions are mentioned in the list below:
* Check your list of mods: make sure that you don't have client-side mods on your server, since it's a client-side mod, you only need it on your Minecraft client, not on your server. You can also remove mods that you will not use, it's not really a good idea to have mods on your server that you will not even use.
* Increase RAM: The modpack page usually provides what's the required amount of RAM for your server to run smoothly, increasing at least 1GB of RAM might help but it's not guaranteed.
